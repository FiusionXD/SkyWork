# SkyWork
SkyWork is a Minecraft server framework where you have a bungee cord and a lobby. You don't need to set anything up. We do all that.

This framework may not be sold. If it is sold anywhere, there will be a strike immediately.

How I came up with the idea of creating my own framework for Minecraft servers. | I was bored and wondering what it's like to create your own Minecraft Framework. Well I've watched a lot of tutorials on this topic and yes now I can create frameworks just like that.
